# Password

Secure password hashing and verification utilities built on top of **Argon2id**,
the recommended modern password hashing algorithm.

These helpers are designed for **server-side environments only** and provide
strong defaults while remaining configurable for advanced use cases.

---

## Usage

### Basic usage

```ts
import { hashPassword, verifyPassword } from '@nofinite/utils/password';

const hash = await hashPassword('my-secret-password');

const isValid = await verifyPassword('my-secret-password', hash);
````

---

### Hashing a password

```ts
const hash = await hashPassword('super-secure-password');
```

* Returns a self-contained hash string
* Includes salt and parameters internally
* Safe to store directly in your database

---

### Verifying a password

```ts
const isValid = await verifyPassword(
  'user-input-password',
  storedPasswordHash
);
```

* Returns `true` if the password matches
* Returns `false` on mismatch or error
* Never throws during verification

---

## API

### hashPassword

Hash a plain-text password using Argon2id.

```ts
async function hashPassword(
  password: string
): Promise<string>
```

#### Behavior

* Uses Argon2id (hybrid variant)
* Automatically generates a random salt
* Encodes all parameters into the hash output

---

### verifyPassword

Verify a password against a stored hash.

```ts
async function verifyPassword(
  password: string,
  hash: string
): Promise<boolean>
```

#### Behavior

* Uses constant-time comparison internally
* Returns `false` if verification fails
* Safe to call with invalid or malformed hashes

## Default Security Parameters

The following defaults are chosen to balance security and performance:

| Parameter   | Value    | Description                               |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Algorithm   | Argon2id | Resistant to GPU and side-channel attacks |
| Memory Cost | 64 MB    | Defends against brute-force attacks       |
| Time Cost   | 3        | Number of hashing iterations              |
| Parallelism | 1        | Thread usage                              |

These values are suitable for most production servers.

---

## Environment Compatibility

* Node.js
* Next.js (API routes, server actions)
* Server-only runtimes

Not supported in browsers.

---

## Security Notes

* Passwords are never stored or returned in plain text
* Always hash passwords before persisting them
* Verification failures are intentionally silent
* Hash format is forward-compatible with future upgrades

---

## Performance Considerations

* Hashing is intentionally slow by design
* Avoid running password hashing in tight loops
* Consider background workers for bulk operations

---

## Best Practices

### Do

* Hash passwords immediately on receipt
* Use strong password policies upstream
* Store hashes exactly as returned
* Use HTTPS for password transmission

### Don’t

* Re-hash an already hashed password
* Log passwords or hashes
* Use fast hashing algorithms (e.g. SHA, MD5)
* Perform password hashing on the client
